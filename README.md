**"Inertia and Motion Under the Substrate Response"**  
by Michael Bush (2025)

## ðŸ“˜ Summary

This paper presents a structural reinterpretation of motion, inertia, and momentum using the **Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD)** framework. Motion is described not as traversal through space, but as **scalar re-locking** of coherence structures within a conserved substrate. Inertia arises from **causal resistance to reconfiguration**, and Newtonian behavior is recovered as a regime of this deeper substrate constraint.

This work is the first to apply the **Substrate Response Law (SRL)** â€” the foundational principle of **General Substrate Theory (GST)** â€” to classical motion, acceleration, rotation, and weight.

## ðŸ”¬ Core Contributions

- Defines inertia as **substrate reconfiguration resistance**
- Interprets momentum as **coherence flow commitment**
- Reframes weight as **denied scalar re-locking in a gravitational gradient**
- Introduces **coherence transport velocity**:  
  \( v_{\text{coh}} = \frac{L_{\text{coh}}}{t_{\text{tick}}} \)
- Shows Newtonâ€™s second law as an **emergent effect** of scalar substrate tension
- Includes testable predictions (e.g. spin-down heating, geometry-linked inertia)
